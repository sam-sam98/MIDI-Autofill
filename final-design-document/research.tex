\subsection{Music Technology}

\subsubsection{MIDI}

MIDI stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface, and it is used to communicate music
to computers in separate parts. MIDI files themselves do not contain any audio. Instead,
they send system and channel messages. Each message describes several features, but in
this project we are primarily concerned with note ON/OFF and the timing clock. The note
ON/OFF tells which notes are playing during a certain event and at what velocity. The
timing clock keeps track of when each event is scheduled to occur.

Between these two features we can determine pitch, timing, and expression - the three
components of a note which determine whether or not it is melodic in context.

\subsubsection{DAW}
\label{sec:daw}

DAW stands for Digital Audio Workstation. DAWs are the software that provide an interface
through which users can alter the contents of a MIDI or other audio file. Because our DAW
is to be isolated to a MIDI controller, it  will only contain functions concerning MIDI
data. When dealing with MIDIs, DAWs visualize audio in a piano roll display. The
foundation of the piano roll is a set of rows, each one representing a piano key and its
corresponding note. The horizontal axis represents the timing clock data. For each note
that plays in the MIDI, the piano roll displays a colored bar located in the row of the
corresponding note and spanning the length of the corresponding timing clock data.
Additionally, some DAWs show the velocity of the note by the color of the bar - most
commonly, red denotes high velocity while blue/violet denotes low velocity.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{image/PianoRoll.png}
  \caption{Example of a piano roll display}
  \label{fig:piano_roll}
\end{figure}

The most basic ways a DAW can alter a MIDI are by adding, deleting, and editing notes on
the piano roll; users can change the timing, pitch, and/or velocity of any note. DAWs can
also quantize notes, meaning they will automatically shift the timing of the notes so that
every note begins on some specified fraction of the tempo (most commonly a thirty-second
note). This function is especially useful in adjusting for human errors in timing when
writing MIDIs with a MIDI controller. Better timing makes it easier to synchronize with
other tracks that might end up in the same audio file.


\subsection{AI}

Our original concept for the AI model took a computer vision approach. To begin we would
have had to develop a script which could convert between MIDI data and a PNG
visualization. This image would be similar in structure to what might show on the piano
roll display of a DAW. Each pixel along the vertical axis would represent a key on the
MIDI controller, and each pixel along the horizontal axis would represent some small
fraction of a beat - hypothetically the length of a sixty-forth note, as this is the
shortest common time interval in music. The hue of each pixel would denote the velocity
of the note being played at that time and pitch - a black pixel would mean no note is
being played while a white pixel would show a note being played at maximum velocity.
These images could then be fed into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which would
replicate the visual patterns and thereby output an image that can be converted back into
a MIDI of a completed melody.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{image/MIDIsample.png}
  \caption{Example of a visualized MIDI file}
  \label{fig:midi_sample}
\end{figure}

This approach was originally considered for its advantages over a more direct MIDI-based
AI. For starters, when conducting some test trials, it was found that the PNG
visualizations are about a quarter the file size of the original MIDIs they were converted
from. This, in conjunction with the comparatively easy calculations of a CNN on a
simplistic bitmap, suggested that a computer vision model would be fast to train.

Additionally, patterns in music are much easier to recognize through visualization than
through note data. Much of the music theory that determines whether a note is melodic in
context is generalized in that it works according to intervals as opposed to discrete
relationships between specific notes. MIDI files don't provide any information about
scales or chords; they simply list which notes were played. It might take an AI a good bit
of to recognize that the interval between C and E is the same as the interval between F
and A - and even longer still to determine which intervals are musically dissonant or not,
and in which contexts. When music is visualized, however, it can generalize the same way
it does in abstract theory. Melodic intervals appear visually the same, regardless of the
root note. So rather than having to learn separately that C pairs well with E and F pairs
well with A, it can generalize that any note will pair well with the note that is four
semitones (or in the AI's case, four pixels) above it, known in music theory as the major
third.

The computer vision model was also favored for its level of technical skill. As students,
we have been exposed to the concept of CNNs but have not yet had the opportunity to apply
them. This model felt appropriate for our skill level because it is centered around a
technique we already understand, but it also implements that technique to a degree we have
never attempted before.

\subsubsection{PixelCNN}

For the computer vision model, our lead candidate was PixelCNN. Like a standard CNN,
PixelCNN processes its image inputs an alternating series of masked convolution and
pooling. The "masks" used in the convolution layer are square matrices, and each element
of the matrix is a numerical value that denotes the weight of that element. These masks
are iterated over the input image, convolving with the brightness of the pixels under the
mask. In colored images, the process is repeated once for each color channel: red, green,
and blue. Depending on the configuration of the weights in the matrix, different masks can
be used to identify different visual patterns. Each convolution with each mask outputs a
two-dimensional array of values called a feature map. The feature maps are then put
through an activation function, which modifies the values in the feature map to exaggerate
the separation between values above a certain threshold and  values below it.

Unlike a standard CNN, however, PixelCNN specifically uses masks that only allows it to
read one pixel at a time: row by row, and left to right in each row. This enforces that
each pixel is dependent upon only those above and to the left of itself. Using this unique
relationship, PixelCNN has a unique use-case in predicting the bottom half of an image
after processing the top half as input.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{image/PixelMask.png}
  \caption{PixelCNN's unique mask prevents the AI from peeking ahead}
  \label{fig:pixel_mask}
\end{figure}

This made PixelCNN a particularly appropriate candidate for our computer vision model
because completing an image after processing the first half is exactly the mechanic we
planned to use to achieve the melody autofill. All we would have to do is rotate the input
image such that the time axis propagates top to bottom as opposed to left to right.
Additionally, the dependencies that PixelCNN establishes simulate dependencies in music
really well. Whether or not a note is melodic depends on its context - specifically, the
notes that came before it in time as well as the other notes being played at the same
time. Adjusting the axes, PixelCNN's dependency upon all pixels above equates to the
current note being dependent on all notes that were played before it. As for its left to
right dependency, chords are typically built upward from the root - which, when rotated,
would be left to right.

Our main challenge in the use of PixelCNN would be the collection and preprocessing of
training data. For this model to work for our purposes, we would have to convert each MIDI
file into a piano roll visualization which is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

\subsubsection{Magenta}

As an alternative, we could use an existent open source solution. Magenta is an open
source project for artistic applications developed by Google AI\autocite{magentaHome}.
This project has released in 2018 an extensive AI library for art and music. This one,
contains already trained models, API and datasets that can be directly used to solve our
problem. Although, the level of functionalities already included in these libraries can
defeat the academic purpose of the current project, there are valuables tools to create
our own autocomplete AI model.

As an already functional solution that can be directly applied to our work without any
modification is the module MusicRNN\autocite{musicRNN}. This one contains three models of
interest: MelodyRNN, ImprovRNN, and PerformanceRNN. All these models, as their name
implies, are based on recurrent neural netoworks (RNN) produced with Google's TensorFlow.

In constrast with the already mentioned CNN, that processes grid values as is a picture, 
RNN processes sequential data as string of caracthers, words, or in our case of 
interest, melody representations. RNN also considers proccesed information along large
sequnces of data, and not purely local extent as CNN.\autocite{fundamentalML}

\paragraph{MelodyRNN.}
MelodyRNN model generates melody based on an input melody. To achieve this, it uses a long
short-term memory (LMST) network. This is a variant of RNN design to improve the
performance of regulr RNN across large sequenes of data. The main issues that LMST adress
are those related to the exploding gradients and vanishing gradients magnified on any
recursive network due to the accumulation of errors on the successive feedbacks of data
analysis.\autocite{melodyRNN}

\paragraph{ImprovRNN.}
ImprovRNN \autocite{improvRNN}

\paragraph{PerformanceRNN.}
PerformanceRNN \autocite{performanceRNN}


\subsection{Embedded Controller Comparisons}
\label{sec:embedded_controllers}

\blindtext

\subsection{DAW Frontend Technologies}

We are looking to use a browser-based frontend Design. This approach is ideal for its ease
of implementing a user interface as well as its cross-platform compatibility. Should we
decide to make the software even more portable by isolating it from the MIDI controller,
it will be viewable on any device that can run a browser. And because of the computational
limits of the MIDI controller, any modern device that is suited for a browser will
inherently be able to run the MIDI autofill software as well.

Our first consideration was React. Considering our group's familiarity with JavaScript as
well as HTML and similar markup languages, it would be easier to work with. However, we
ultimately opted to use Flutter. Flutter's default stylization is sleek and fits in well
with the modern aesthetic of technology. Plus, its widgets allow for more polish on a UI
that also has more niche functionality.

As established in \textbf{\ref{sec:daw} \nameref{sec:daw}}, the primary aspect of the UI
will be the piano roll display. The frontend will be responsible for reading the MIDI
messages and converting the note ON/OFF and timing clock features into the position and
dimensions of an arbitrary number of UI elements - each representing a note which can be
edited.

\subsection{Raspberry Pi}

As mentioned in \textbf{\ref{sec:embedded_controllers}\nameref{sec:embedded_controllers}},
the Raspberry Pi is mini-computer which can also function as an embedded controller. The
model we're interested in is the Raspberry Pi 4B, which is the latest model and has the
best hardware. After an analysis of other solutions, we have decided that the
Raspberry Pi is the best fit for our project. To that end, we have researched how the
Raspberry Pi can be configured for use in our project.

\subsubsection{Operating System Choice}

The first configuration choice that needs to be made is the operating system. A Raspberry
Pi out of the box has no operating system. An image must be flashed to an SD card to make
the Raspberry Pi useful. Raspberry Pi's typically run some form of Linux. The Raspberry Pi
4B model uses the AArch64 architecture. It can run most AArch64 based Linux distros, but
we must limit ourselves to armv7 (32 bit) operating systems, as tensorflow does not
natively support ARM64 as of the time of writing. Tensorflow lite supports ARM64, but
tensorflow-lite has a limited number of supported operations, which can inhibit our
development. There are many OS choices available, as there are many flavors of Linux that
can run on the armv7 architecture. Some common choices for Raspberry Pi include Raspberry
Pi OS (formerly known as Raspian), Arch Linux ARM, and DietPi. Each OS has its advantages
and drawbacks, and it is important for us to select a distro that is well suited for our
use case. We will need to modify the system heavily for our purposes, but we need a good
baseline for modification.

We need our distro to be a lightweight bootloader for our application. There are many
examples of highly specialized distros designed for one specific task. Examples
include RetroPIE, which is used to run retro video games, or OpenMediaVault, which is used
to turn the device into a networked storage device. This is similar to what we want our
operating system to do. Our use case for the Raspberry Pi is to run one specialized
application that we ourselves develop. It should boot straight into our application with
no other UI from the operating system. The best solution for us is to have a custom distro
just for running our application. Developing a Linux distro from scratch is a difficult
process that is out of the scope of this project. But what we can do is modify an existing
distro to suite our needs. We plan to do this process using a tool called Packer,
described in more detail in section \ref{sec:packer}.

The most common operating system used for Raspberry Pi is Raspberry Pi OS. This is a
specially tailored version of Debian for the Raspberry Pi. This is a common choice for any
general purpose usage the Pi. It can be used like a normal desktop computer when a mouse,
keyboard, and monitor are plugged in. This is a "batteries included" distro that includes
many things we will never use. The bloatware from this distro can hinder performance and
waste SD card space. There is a lightweight alternative known as Raspberry Pi OS Lite.
This version does not include any desktop environment. We think it would be better to
start with an even lighter weight distro, such as DietPi.

DietPi is like Raspberry Pi OS Lite in that it is a lightweight distro. DietPi's claims to
be even lighter than Raspberry Pi Os Lite. It occupies 589 Mb on the SD card, while
Raspberry Pi OS occupies 1424 MB. There are other system optimizations in place to improve
general performance as well. After boot, there are 11 total processes, versus 18 total
processes running on Raspberry Pi OS. This is a good choice for base system. It is easier
for us to start lightweight and add what we need, rather than to start with a bloated
system and strip it down. DietPi includes an easy way to run chromium in kiosk mode using
the \url{dietpi-autostart} utility, which we'll need to have configured anyways, as
described in section \ref{sec:research:subsec:os_config}.


\subsubsection{Operating System Configuration}
\label{sec:research:subsec:os_config}

The operating system will need to be configured for our use-case. We need to get the
operating system to boot a single GUI application, our DAW, without displaying any other
UI from the desktop environment (DE). There may be more applications separate from the DAW
that will run in the background which also must  immediately after boot. The
operating system will need to be configured to not permit any networking out of security
and privacy concerns.

To only display a single application, we need to configure the graphics system in our
distro. Graphics in Linux are done through the X Window System. In modern apps, X is
mostly agnostic to the UI, and is used for providing UI toolkits a method for accessing
bitmaps to windows. X can be configured in a variety of ways. The way we intend to
configure X is to host a single fullscreen application for our DAW. This can be done
through the \url{.xinitrc} file. This file specifies which commands to run whenever the X
server starts. By including the command to run our application in there, we will have a
single window at startup.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, label={lst:xinitrc}, caption=Example .xinitrc]
#!/bin/sh

exec chromium --kiosk http://127.0.0.1:8080/
\end{lstlisting}

Because our app is browser based, the startup application will be a web browser. In our
case we want to use the Chromium browser, which is the open source variant of Google
Chrome. Chromium has a feature called Kiosk mode, which puts the browser in fullscreen
with no border or frame \autocite{chromiumKioskMode}. This in combination with the xinitrc
file fulfills our requirement of only having a single fullscreen application with no other
UI. This feature can be enabled through the \url{--kiosk} command line flag
\autocite{chromiumKioskMode}. See \nameref{lst:xinitrc} for an example of an xinitrc that
launches chromium in fullscreen mode.

Networking can disabled through the \url{/etc/network/interfaces} config file. This config
file is used to declare all networking interfaces, and the interfaces can be removed by
simply removing all lines declaring a networking interface in that file.

\subsubsection{Packer}
\label{sec:packer}

A solution we found for customizing an existing Linux distro is Packer. Packer is a
utility that can take an existing operating system image, change it, and produce a new
image. Modification is done through provisioners, which exist to perform steps, such as
copying files, running shell commands, setting permissions, etc. Packer relies on builders
to carry out the tasks laid out in a configuration file. The builder we will use is called
packer-builder-arm, which builds ARM images and is suitable for a Raspberry Pi.

We can use our own Packer config file to setup all the tasks described in
\nameref{sec:research:subsec:os_config}. For example, the file provisioner can copy the
\url{.xinitrc} file to the home directory, which configures X11 for our application.

\subsubsection{Performance}

Performance is always a concern when dealing with constrained embedded hardware. The
Raspberry Pi fares better than microcontrollers you would find in a typical MIDI
controller, but is still performance constrained. Our device needs to be able to run a
machine learning model and a UI application, both of which are computationally expensive
tasks.

\paragraph{Magenta.}

Magenta serves as a good baseline for measuring performance of music generating AI.
Magenta ships with two machine learning models: MusicRNN and MusicVAE. We have performance
tested both of these in a demo benchmark program on the Raspberry Pi 4B.

The benchmark program we constructed uses Magenta with JavaScript. We use the Tensorflow
node backend for good CPU performance with Node. The program uses both the MusicRNN and
MusicVAE models, with checkpoints that are hosted are Google's servers. The checkpoints
tested are the \url{basic_rnn}, \url{melody_rnn}, and \url{drum_kit_rnn} checkpoints for
the MusicRNN, and the \url{mel_4bar_small_q2} checkpoint for \url{MusicVAE}. The benchmarks
use a JavaScript benchmarking framework called Benny to run several test cases with
magenta, sampling each one several times and providing statistics such as the min, max,
and mean generation time, as well as the standard deviation.

Our benchmarking program has two benchmarking suites: a generalized one to gauge overall
performance (see \nameref{appendix:magenta_benchmark}) and a linear suite to find out what
factors affect performance the most.

In the generalized suite, the MusicRNN model with the provided pretrained checkpoints has
shown good performance overall when autofilling simple and random melodies, well below the
5 second threshold in general with a few edge cases that exceed 5 seconds. With this
knowledge we know its feasible to run a music generating AI on the Raspberry Pi. What we
need to know is how much we are able to push the music generating AI before we fall below
our threshold. This is where the linear benchmarks come in.

The linear benchmarks allow us to figure out what constraints we have to limit ourselves
to in order to stay below our 5 second threshold. There are three main factors that we
speculated will affect the performance. For each of these benchmark factors, we
progressively test higher amounts and graph the results (See \autoref{fig:magentaperf}).

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Melody duration.} This is the duration of the input melody in seconds.
  \item \textbf{Number of notes.} Total number of notes in the input melody. This is with
        a constant duration of 16 seconds.
  \item \textbf{Generation steps.} Each generation step represents a quarter note in these
        benchmarks. The duration is constant at 16 seconds.
\end{itemize}

All benchmarks in this suite use random notes quantized to quarter steps. The random notes
fit the checkpoints supported note rage, which is different between checkpoints. For
example, the \url{basic_rnn} checkpoint supports pitches in the range \url{[48, 84]},
while \url{melody_rnn} supports the full MIDI range of \url{[0, 127]}.

With this data collected, it becomes easy to analyze what constraints we are working
with. Our target is to remain below 5 seconds of generation time, so we need to ensure
that we have a safe margin below where the graphs meet 5 seconds. The generation time
increases linearly with melody duration and total generation steps. The generation time
remains constant when the total number of notes increases.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{image/perf.pdf}
  \caption{Magenta Generation Time on the Raspberry Pi 4B}
  \label{fig:magentaperf}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{UI.} It is important to verify that a Raspberry Pi can even run a browser based
DAW with acceptable performance before spending development time creating the web app.
Since we have not developed the DAW at this point, we have tested an existing web based
MIDI editor in the Raspberry Pi.

We used an online MIDI editor called signal (\url{https://signal.vercel.app/}) to get a
subjective feel for the performance. The test was ran in the chromium web browser on
Raspberry Pi OS. The performance was acceptable, with some actions feeling slow.
Dragging around notes had a small but noticeable latency between the mouse cursor's
movement and the notes position. There was also a small but noticeable latency between
double clicking to insert a note and the note showing up on screen.

It should be noted that this app was not explicitly designed to run on constrained
hardware. Based on our findings here we are confident that we can develop a browser based
app that has exceptional performance on the Raspberry Pi.

\subsection{MIDI Peripheral}

The Pi needs to function as a MIDI peripheral, i.e. plug the device into a computer and it
functions as a device that sends MIDI commands to the DAW. This connection will happen
through a USB-C to USB-A cable from the Raspberry Pi to the computer. The Raspberry Pi is
typically powered from the USB-C port form a power supply connected to a power outlet, but
in our case the Pi will receive it's power from the host PC over USB-C instead. Once
plugged in, the Pi will act as a normal MIDI peripheral, which sends MIDI events to the
PC, which can be picked up by a fully fledged DAW.

The MIDI communication happens over USB in our case, which means we need to work with the
operating system to send these messages. We are using Linux for our device's operating
system, so USB communication needs to happen through the Linux kernel. This is known as a
USB Gadget in the Linux kernel \autocite{usbGadgetDocumentation}. The Raspberry Pi 4b can
act as a Linux USB Gadget through a USB-C to USB-A connection to the computer, with USB-C
being on the Raspberry Pi and USB-A being on the host computer
\autocite{raspberryPiGadgetSetup}. This will not work out of the box, as the Linux kernel
needs to be made aware that we intend to use the device as a USB gadget. This
configuration happens through files in the \url{/boot/} directory
(see listings \ref{lst:bootconfig} and
\ref{lst:bootcmdline}) \autocite{raspberryPiGadgetSetup}. The Pi will act as a USB
gadget after Linux boot configuration settings are set and it is plugged up to the host
machine.

  \end{lstlisting}

\end{minipage}

After the boot configuration options are set, the device will be a USB gadget, but there
is more configuration needed for it to act as a MIDI USB gadget. The Linux kernel already
provides an interface for USB gadgets to act as MIDI devices, through the
\url{usb_f_midi.ko} kernel module \autocite{usbGadgetDocumentation}. We need to set our
Raspberry Pi's USB gadget settings to identify itself as a MIDI peripheral. We have
followed an online guide to setup this MIDI gadget, which involves providing information
to the kernel about our device through the \url{/sys/kernel/config/usb_gadget/} folder
\autocite{raspberryPiGadgetSetup}.

This works, but we ran into a problem with our setup where our HDMI connection to the
monitor was not working anymore. This connection is critical, as we need to be able to
display our DAW to the built in connection using HDMI, so we had to find a workaround for
this issue. We found out that there are \url{/boot/config.txt} options that can added to
force an HDMI connection, using the \url{hdmi_force_hotplug} option
\autocite{raspberryPiHDMIFix}. This configuration as well as some other HDMI settings can
be seen in listing \ref{lst:bootconfig}.

We have also ran into some low voltage warnings when running the Raspberry Pi 4B as a USB
gadget. These warnings are found in systemlogs and are viewed with \url{journalctl}. The
Raspberry Pi 4b requires 5.1 volts and 3 amps to operate effectively, and will send the
undervolt warning whenever it runs below 4.63 volts
\autocite{raspberryPiAmps}. We notice that we see these warnings early in the boot, but it
seems to stabilize later. We have not run into any issues with these undervolts as of now.
The Pi does not encounter anymore voltage warnings when running a CPU stress test, but it
could lead to stability issues later.  We are still researching  solutions to this
problem.


\subsection{Keyboard Design}
