\section{Specifications and Requirements}

\subsection{DAW Integrated Keyboard}

Create a MIDI controller with an integrated and complete Digital Audio
Workstation(DAW) in the system. The DAW will be able to interact with the user
via the keyboard, which acts as the MIDI controller, and can export a completed
MIDI file to a third party computer.

\subsection{Quantization}

The DAW will be able to Quantize a user recording to best fit the perceived
tempo of the recording being played. Users will also be able to adjust said
recording to find the perfect location for each not

\subsection{Auto Fill}

The device will be able to fill in a melody to help the user create a unique
piece of music that falls into a specific genre selected.

\subsection{Auto Correct}

The device will be able to offer suggestions on a given piece to improve it to
better fit the genre selected.

\subsection{Education Mode}

The device will be able to help in the teaching of newer users or musicians to
master the art of composition and playing melodies.

\subsection{Batterylife}

The device will be able to remain operational for six hours disconnected to any
given power supply. This will allow the user to change location and find a place
of inspiration before composing a musical piece

\subsection{Energy Consumption}

The device will consume no more than 12 watts in a given moment. This will allow
for an extended battery life to longer times and mitigate the environmental
impact of the MIDI controller

\subsection{Processing Time}

The time it takes to compute a given function will take no longer than 5
seconds, limiting user frustration upon perceived lag. This will also force an
efficient solution to the Energy consumption problem as the longer the device
uses the main computing unit the more power it will consume.
