\subsection{Broader Impacts}

One of the most difficult aspects of producing music as a hobby is a lack of
accessible equipment. Often, it requires several pieces of hardware at over \$100
each as well as licensed software to compose a polished track. This expensive
and convoluted process restricts the reach of music production as an art. As
technology expands into the music production world, the art becomes more
accessible to the everyday person, and the MIDI Autofill keyboard will be yet
another step along that path. With recording, editing, and auto-completion all
conveniently packaged into a single portable piece of equipment, novice
producers can begin completing polished tracks without having to seek out,
invest in, and store a stockpile of hardware.

Additionally, the autofill feature can benefit new practitioners and
professionals alike. One of the biggest stressors in songwriting is writer’s
block -– it can completely bottleneck the production process and halt all
progress until resolved. For beginners this can be frustrating and discourage
further exploration into the art, and for professionals this can come at the
detriment of deadlines. The melody autofill feature can provide inspiration or
even an immediate solution, expediting the process and allowing artists to be
more productive with their ideas. The goal is to empower independent creators
because the more people can express themselves through art, the richer and more
diverse our culture and society become.
