\section{Project Overview}
\subsection{Function of the Project}

The final product of this project should serve as a music production and music
education tool. The keyboard itself will allow the user to interactively experiment with
writing melodies, and the autofill feature will assist in expanding the user’s capability.
For music production it can kickstart the writing process, allowing a smooth and
constant flow of ideas and creativity, thereby boosting the productivity of the user.
For music education it can, through demonstration, teach stylistic patterns and
structures that the user can mimic in their own writing to create a similar sound.


\subsection{Design Criteria}

Aside from achieving base functionality, there are few requirements regarding the
product’s design. Its keys should be aesthetically and structurally reminiscent of a
piano, to make for more intuitive use. Additionally, the visualization of the melody in
the DAW should follow the horizontal bar format seen in most standard MIDI editors.

\subsection{Constraints}

The primary constraint of this project will be hardware. Both the AI model and Digital
Audio Workstation will need to be operating without the assistance of external
processing power. Additionally, we hope to make this product affordable. To meet
these needs, we will need to strike a balance between the complexity of the software
and the capabilities of decently priced hardware.
